# Madgraph Tutorial

## prerequisites

The reader is assumed to have familiarity with the Linux operative system,
the use of the terminal shell,
the C++ programming language and the ROOT data analysis package.

## general structure

The tutorial assumes no prior knowledge of the reader
about the Madgraph generator,
while relies on general knowledge
typical of the first year of a master in high-energy physics.
Each chapter addresses a single subject,
and chapters are expected to be read in sequence.

## table of content

  * [Chapter 1](01_intro.md): introduction on event generation
